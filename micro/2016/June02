QUESTION 3.1

Suppose that you are a teaching assistant for a freshman microeconomics course that involves no calculus. A student comes to office hours and does not understand why the market equillibrium (in the absence of market failures) is efficient. Nor does the student understand why market power (e.g., monopoly and oligopoly) sometimes leads to inefficient market outcomes and sometimes leads to efficient market outcomes despite the existence of market power. Using graphs and langugage appropriate for a freshman student, help answer the student's questions (2 pages max.)

The fundamental issue of economics is the organization of productiona dnt he allocation of the resulting commodities among consumers. This can be addressed in two ways:

POSITIVE/DESCRIPTIVE : The determinatin of production and consumption under various institutional mechanisms, often looking for Market Equilibrium, which is an outcome of the market economy in which each agent in the economy (i.e., each consumer and firm) is doing as well as he can given the actions of all other agents. 

NORMATIVE/PRESCRIPTIVE : We might alternatively try to arrive at a "socially optimal" plan of production and consumption, which can be used to assess the relative performance of elements of the economy. 


.....

We know from FFTWE that when markets are complete (all goods traded in the market at publicly known prices, and agents act competitively), any competitive equilibrium is necessarily Pareto Optimal. 

Market equillibrium in the absence of market failures is efficient because the Marshallian Aggregate Surplus (MAS, which is equivalent to the utility generated from the consumption of a good minus it's cost of production) is maximized. This result is supported by the FFTWE. A good's price in comp eq will represent its marginal social value, (firms produce at P = MC).

Monopoly production is inefficient because under typical conditions, price under monopoly exceeds Marginal Cost at competitive equillibrium and the resulting deadweight loss under monopoly reduces the MAS. (See MWG Chp 12, Fig. 12.B.1 pp 386). However, under special cases in which p'(q) = 0 for all q, monopolist production is identical to that of a price-taking competitive firm. (It perceives that any increase in its price above the competitive price, causes it to lose all its sales. MWG, Fig 12.B.2, pp 386).

QUESTION 3.2

Suppose that you are a teaching assistant for an intermediate undergraduate microeconomics course. A student studying duopolies comes to your office and is confused about the difference between Bertrand, Cournot, and Stackelberg models. Briefly ( 1 paragraph max) explain the three models. 
_________________________________________________________________

Bertrand and Cournot models deal with static forms of oligopoly, where firms compete SIMULTANEOUSLY over the price of their output, and the quantity of their output respectively. In the Stackelberg model, there is a firm who assumes the role of a leader and acts first, and all of the firms respond to the leader's production.
